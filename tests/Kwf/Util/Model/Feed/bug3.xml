The beautiful and majestic animals need to be groomed well. The horse barns where the horses are kept need to be cleaned and maintained well! Horse barns need to be maintained for the hygiene, which is necessary for you and the animal as well. There are basic guidelines for horse barn maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YIe-dMvXegk/Se8niNX1jTI/AAAAAAAAABs/7vkGHYpyH9s/s1600-h/Gracie+and+foal+034.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5327520352861261106" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 200px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 150px" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YIe-dMvXegk/Se8niNX1jTI/AAAAAAAAABs/7vkGHYpyH9s/s200/Gracie+and+foal+034.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cleaning and maintaining a barn is a tough job, make sure that you are properly outfitted. Carhartt has created and manufactured premium work clothing known for exceptional durability, comfort, quality of construction, and fit that you can feel in the fabrics and see in the performance. Along with the Carhartt line of durable work wear, your work boots are just as important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horse Barn Maintenance Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Ensure to check the drainage system of the horse barns. This would help you prevent any flooding or clogging of the horse barn. Choose a nice and bright sunny day to clean the barn floor so that the natural sunlight enters the barn and helps it to dry easily. You must also consult a professional if any drainage problem persists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the dirt, the manure, dust and the chaff also tend to hold a lot of moisture and this can really turn dirty during the wet weather. Therefore, horse barns that have dirt floors need to have the top layer removed. You may need to add new soil to this. If maintained properly, it will keep the area clean and free from dirt and stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure when you clean out all the feedbags and the other materials, use a handcart to carry out the dirt so that it does not dirty the floor. This will save you mopping the floor yet another time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get some rubber mats from the market, as these will prove to be a wise buy when it comes to the horse barn maintenance. Rubber mats are easy to clean and maintain and can be used as a base for the horses to stand upon while you go about cleaning the ground of the horse barn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to keep the horse barns maintained on a regular basis with the help of a power blower. A power blower can work with the help of electricity and can you clean up the place more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure you pick the right tools that are required for horse barn maintenance. Try to invest in lightweight wheelbarrows and other such tools that will help you finish your tasks with great ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the various types of feed tubs and pick those feed tubs that are detachable and very easy to clean. This will reduce the process of cleaning of the tubs and the mess that may be created by certain horses whilst they eat from the feed tubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add some panels in easy to reach areas whilst you are cleaning the entire place. These panels on the walls can help you hang the required materials which may assist you in the cleaning process and save frequent trips to the other side of the horse barn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintain one cleaning routine for the horse barn. Start from a specific area to maintain uniformity in the maintenances process. Try to maintain a particular pattern that will help you simplify the way you manage the waste removal process. With this method, you can decide how you can place the tools needed for the maintenance of the horse barn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure you clean the loft on a regular basis. This will help you keep the area clean without all the odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep a regular check on the horse stables walls, windows etc for any need of replacement or repair. This would save you a lot of time when it comes to maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope that the above tip will help you to clean it with more ease on a regular basis so that the horse barns become more inhabitable for the horses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;http://www.workwear1.com/&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-4798876002545888123?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/4798876002545888123/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2009/04/horse-barn-maintenance.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/4798876002545888123?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/4798876002545888123?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2009/04/horse-barn-maintenance.html" title="Horse Barn Maintenance" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YIe-dMvXegk/Se8niNX1jTI/AAAAAAAAABs/7vkGHYpyH9s/s72-c/Gracie+and+foal+034.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CU8DQXYzfyp7ImA9WxVaF08.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-760865663023880475</id><published>2009-04-14T08:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-04-14T08:44:30.887-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2009-04-14T08:44:30.887-07:00</app:edited><title>Michigan’s Black Bear Management</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is working to develop a Statewide Bear Management Plan. We hope to have the plan finalized in the Spring of 2009. Public involvement throughout the planning process is critical in order to create a plan that is acceptable to as many Michigan citizens as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mission of the Department's black bear management program is to maintain a healthy black bear population that provides a balance of recreational opportunities for residents while at the same time minimizing conflicts with humans. Goals of the Management Plan are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;1. Maintain a viable bear population within habitats suitable for the species where socially acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;2. Maintain bear abundance at levels compatible with land use, recreational opportunities, and the public's acceptance capacity for bear.&lt;br /&gt;3. Manage black bear habitat to provide for the long-term viability of the species.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use hunting as the primary tool to help achieve population goals.&lt;br /&gt;5. In addition to hunting, provide bear-related recreational opportunities, which recognize the aesthetic value of bear.&lt;br /&gt;6. Promote education about bears and bear-related recreational activities, and how to minimize negative human-bear interactions.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Natural Resources is once again seeking help from hunters and trappers through the winter who encounter denned black bears while in the field in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. In the Northern Lower Peninsula, this effort is part of an ongoing DNR program to annually radio-collar a sample of female bears. Bears are also becoming more common in the Southern Lower Peninsula and biologists are interested in learning more about their movements and habitat associations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After locating a denned bear, DNR biologists will determine if the animal is a good candidate for radio-collaring. Bears that are selected will be sedated by a biologist and fitted with a radio-tracking collar and ear tags. Hair samples will be taken for DNA analysis and a small non-functional tooth will be collected to determine the bear's age. Upon completion of the short procedure, biologists will carefully return the bear to their den where it will sleep through the remainder of the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who encounter bear dens are asked to record the location, with a GPS unit if possible, and contact Mark Boersen at the DNR Roscommon Operations Center at 989-275-5151 for bears in the Northern Lower Peninsula; or Dwayne Etter at 517-373-9358, ext. 256, for bears in the southern Lower Peninsula. The public is reminded that it is illegal to disturb a bear den or disturb, harm, or molest a bear in its den.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;http://www.workwear1.com/&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-760865663023880475?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/760865663023880475/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2009/04/michigans-black-bear-management.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/760865663023880475?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/760865663023880475?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2009/04/michigans-black-bear-management.html" title="Michigan’s Black Bear Management" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;D0IDQXk6fCp7ImA9WxVSGEs.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-1000471889922624621</id><published>2009-01-13T08:31:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2009-01-13T08:52:50.714-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2009-01-13T08:52:50.714-08:00</app:edited><title>Feral Swine in Michigan</title><content type="html">Hunters with a valid hunting license of any type are encouraged to shoot feral swine (free-ranging wild pigs) in counties shaded in gray on the map below.  All prevailing hunting rules and regulations apply. In states where feral swine have become established, they have caused crop damage, pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of the domestic swine, endanger humans, impact wildlife populations, and impact the environment by disrupting the ecosystem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Officials from the Michigan Departments of Agriculture (MDA) and Natural Resources (DNR) encouraged hunters with a valid hunting license of any type to shoot feral swine (free-ranging wild pigs) in all lower Michigan counties except Leelanau, Charlevoix, Grand Traverse, Benzie, Manistee, Kalkaska, Muskegon, VanBuren, Missaukee, Huron and Macomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In states where feral swine have become established, they have caused crop damage, pose a serious threat to the health and welfare of the domestic swine, endanger humans, impact wildlife populations, and impact the environment by disrupting the ecosystem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because state law protects livestock that may be running at large, special precautions are necessary to guard the rights of farmers. The following locations have had at least one feral pig reported: Arenac, Bay, Baraga, Clinton, Cheboygan, Gladwin, Gratiot, Hillsdale, Isabella, Jackson, Lapeer, Lenawee, Marquette, Mason, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, Montmorency, Newaygo, Oceana, Ogemaw, Roscommon, and Saginaw counties. County prosecutors are aware that shooting feral swine in these counties is permitted and any potential owners of the feral swine have been contacted and do not claim ownership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Hunters, as always, have to be certain of their targets before shooting," said Alan Marble, Bureau Chief of the DNR Law Enforcement Division. "Feral Swine are unfamiliar targets to most Michigan hunters, and sports persons need to make sure they are shooting at hogs and not black bear, dogs, or any other animal."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there is no indication that these animals are carrying pseudorabies or any other disease, precautionary testing will be conducted. Feral swine may also transmit diseases such as brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis (TB) and trichinosis to people and other livestock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A person field-dressing swine, especially in the Northeastern Lower Michigan TB area, should wear gloves. If the lungs, ribcage or internal organs from wild pigs look abnormal (multiple tan or yellow lumps), the meat should not be eaten. The carcass should, however, be removed from the environment and brought to a DNR field office to prevent disease transmission to other animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help eliminate these pests, the DNR encourages hunters to take any legal opportunity to shoot feral swine. They can be unpredictable when and where they show up. Hunters may not easily get a second chance. (Tip) When shooting a pig, aim for the shoulder or slightly ahead of the shoulder. The vital area of a pig is more forward than a deer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-1000471889922624621?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/1000471889922624621/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2009/01/feral-swine-in-michigan.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/1000471889922624621?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/1000471889922624621?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2009/01/feral-swine-in-michigan.html" title="Feral Swine in Michigan" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CUIMSHo4fCp7ImA9WxVSEks.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-7769450611468057145</id><published>2009-01-06T09:13:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2009-01-06T09:39:49.434-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2009-01-06T09:39:49.434-08:00</app:edited><title>WHAT IS ANSI?</title><content type="html">ANSI stand for American National Standards Institute, and the ISEA stands for International Safety Equipment Association, jointly developed a standard for &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,82.html"&gt;high visibility clothing&lt;/a&gt; that is patterned after the EN-471 standard used in Europe.  ANSI and the ISEA are not government agencies, so this standard is really a suggested standard for everyone to look at and choose to adopt on their own.  Many of the states are looking at the standard and some are adopting it, or some variation of it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard covers many details used in the construction of high visibility garments.  Fabric, quality, color, labeling, fading, reflective, quality and quantity, suggested styles, background material quantity (the orange or yellow part), shrinkage and cleaning are all discussed and specified in the standard.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard raises the bar for &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,82.html"&gt;high visibility apparel&lt;/a&gt;.  There are 5 main classes of apparel.  Each state and/or local government has adopted a specification.  Here is a brief overview of each class:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANSI Class 1  - 217 square inches of visible fluorescent background material, usually orange or lime/yellow, and 155 square inches of visible reflective material.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANSI Class PSV – 450 square inches of visible fluorescent background, usually orange or lime/yellow and 201 square inches of &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,82.html"&gt;visible reflective material&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANSI Class 2 – 775 square inches of visible fluorescent background material usually orange or lime/yellow and 201 square inches of visible material. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANSI Class 3 – 1240 square inches of visible fluorescent background materials, usually orange or lime/yellow and 310 square inches of visible reflective material. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANSI Class E – 465 square inches of visible fluorescent background materials, usually orange or lime/yellow and 108 square inches of &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,82.html"&gt;visible reflective material&lt;/a&gt;.  Class E garments are either shorts or pants that are made to be worn with a Class 2 garment to make a Class 3 ensemble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 24, 2008 Federal Rule 23 CFR 634 goes into effect. In summary it states that anyone working in the right-of-way of a federal-aid highway must be wearing &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,82.html"&gt;high-visibility clothing &lt;/a&gt; that meets the requirements of ANSI/ISEA 107-2004 edition class 2 or 3. This rule affects all workers including emergency responder's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: Not all garments sold on our website &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/index.htm"&gt;www.workwear1.com &lt;/a&gt; are ANSI classed.

The limit applies to both dip-net and hook-and-line anglers. This new regulation also takes effect April 1, 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spearing season for pike and muskie will now run from Dec. 1-March 15, instead of just January and February and the whitefish spearing season will now be open year-round. The new seasons are the result of legislation enabling the DNR to set spearing regulations. These regulations take immediate effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anglers have been allowed to use three rods when fishing for salmon on the Great Lakes for a number of years, but were restricted to two rods elsewhere and when pursuing other species in the Great Lakes. A survey of anglers showed overwhelming public support for three rods. The new regulation, which takes effect April 1, 2009, allows anglers to use three rods on all waters and in pursuit of all species, though the DNR retains the authority to reduce the rule to two rods if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-8298370698677046480?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/8298370698677046480/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/12/update-new-fishing-regulations-and.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/8298370698677046480?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/8298370698677046480?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/12/update-new-fishing-regulations-and.html" title="UPDATE: New Fishing Regulations and Limit Smelt Harvest" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;A08AQXg8fyp7ImA9WxRbGU8.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-6714150401771765421</id><published>2008-12-10T08:51:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-10T09:24:00.677-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-12-10T09:24:00.677-08:00</app:edited><title>Snowshoeing a Great Winter Activity:</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The sport is easy to learn, virtually inexpensive (compared to other winter sports), poses little risk of injury and is a great way to exert energy during the cold winter months. According to research, 40.8 percent of snowshoers are women (a number that is increasing rapidly), 9.4 percent of snowshoers are children (ages 7-11), and 44.2 percent of snowshoers are ages 25-44. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more appealing facts about snowshoeing is how it can help enrich a person's health. Known to help maintain or improve cardiovascular fitness, the sport helps burn more than 600 calories per hour. Snowshoers can burn more than 45 percent more calories than walking or running at the same speed. Snowshoeing is a great way to pursue losing weight; however, a healthy diet should be maintained to seek the appropriate effectiveness in a healthy lifestyle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that anyone who can walk can go snowshoeing. From young kids to senior citizens, depending on your age and weight range there will be a shoe that will fit your specific needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons to enjoy the benefits of snowshoeing: A fun, inexpensive and active way to visit the outdoors; simple to learn and easy to access places with snow; great cardiovascular exercise for adults and for kids; an entertaining social group activity and snowshoer’s getting up close and personal with nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snowshoeing expands the potential for exercise available in the wintertime. As of 2006, at least 500&lt;a title="Education in the United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States"&gt;American schools&lt;/a&gt;, mostly but not exclusively in the &lt;a title="Northeastern United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States"&gt;Northeast&lt;/a&gt; have started offering snowshoe programs in their &lt;a title="Physical education" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education"&gt;physical education&lt;/a&gt; classes to help combat &lt;a title="Obesity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;. It has the added benefit of being gentler on the feet than walking or running the equivalent routes, since snow cushions the foot's impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snowshoeing makes even familiar hikes different and new. If the snow is deep enough, obstacles such as large boulders and fallen logs can be more easily bypassed. Winter transforms familiar forests into something wonderful and strange, and clearer, bluer skies in winter often afford more sweeping, longer-range views from favorite lookouts than are available in summer situations. The stillness of the air, quiet and snow cover give &lt;a title="Nature" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; a pristine feel that is sometimes lacking at other times of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is wise to choose your footwear according to your snowshoeing style. Leather hiking boots that have been waterproofed, like &lt;a title="Merrell Boots" href="http://www.michiganshoe.com/browse.cfm/2,18.html"&gt;Merrell Hiking boots&lt;/a&gt;, are great for hiking and backcountry trekking. &lt;a title="Merrell Shoes" href="http://www.michiganshoe.com/browse.cfm/2,18.html"&gt;Trail-running shoes&lt;/a&gt;, also by Merrell, are perfect for running and aerobic snowshoeing (look for GORE-TEX material). Snowboarding boots are also ideal for snowshoeing. Waterproofing is the key! &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Carhartt wool socks" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/4,585.html"&gt;Wool socks&lt;/a&gt;, like those from Carhartt, for hiking and/or a wool/silk combination for running are important to snowshoeing. Never wear cotton socks when in the snowy elements. &lt;p&gt;And, if you plan to snowshoe in deep snow and don't plan to stay on snow-packed trails, wear Gaiters to keep snow out of your boots and shoes. GORE-TEX Gaiters are great selection for backcountry hikers. &lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to dress in layers. And, use layers that can be taken off with ease, considering in some cases it can get hot during the spring season. Consider wearing synthetics and wool to induce heat retention when wet. &lt;a title="Carhartt thermals" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,89.html"&gt;Long underwear&lt;/a&gt;, like those from Carhartt, is essential when snowshoeing and a &lt;a title="Carhartt Thermal Zip Top" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/4,245.html"&gt;zippered top &lt;/a&gt;lets you regulate body heat. &lt;p&gt;Polyester fleece provides a great insulation, as it too retains heat when wet. And, a &lt;a title="Carhartt Waterproof Jackets" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,108.html"&gt;waterproof jacket &lt;/a&gt;(preferably something with GORE-TEX) will keep you dry and protect you from cold winds. The more obvious choices in winter wear are &lt;a title="Carhartt Gloves" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,88.html"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a title="Carhartt Hats" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,98.html"&gt;hat&lt;/a&gt;, sunglasses (or goggles) and other personal selections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than half of all snowshoers being women, who snowshoe for different reasons: for backcountry access, to experience nature, to exercise with friends and family and, above all, to have outdoor fun all winter long ......"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;http://www.workwear1.com/&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-6714150401771765421?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/6714150401771765421/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/12/snowshoeing-great-winter-activity.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/6714150401771765421?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/6714150401771765421?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/12/snowshoeing-great-winter-activity.html" title="Snowshoeing a Great Winter Activity:" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;DkABQXwzcSp7ImA9WxRbGEk.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-7492033842995956469</id><published>2008-12-09T09:25:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-09T09:45:50.289-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-12-09T09:45:50.289-08:00</app:edited><title>Protect Workers with ANSI approved reflective safety vests</title><content type="html">Do your employees work near vehicular traffic? Then they must wear high visibility clothing so that they can be seen by motorists. The ANSI/ISEA 107-2004 standard is the first uniform, authoritative guide for the design, performance specifications, and use of high-visibility and reflective clothing for employees. This standard was modeled after the European standard EN471 by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISEA (International Safety Equipment Association).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration have recently taken a greater interest in high visibility clothing and the work situations in which it should be worn. There have been organizations that have already been cited under 29CFR 1910.132 for not having their workers wear clothing that ensured their conspicuity and/or visibility. In the citations, OSHA named compliance with the ANSI/ISEA 107-2004 standard for high-visibility safety clothing as a method to ensure visibility of workers from all directions under Nighttime construction has heightened the probability that workers will be struck by a motor vehicle. Crews working between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. are three times more likely to be struck, and 25% of all fatal accidents occur during this time period. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANSI-compliant, Class II Reflective Wear&lt;br /&gt;Contrasting colors provide exceptional visibility for added safety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,82.html"&gt;Carhartt High Visibility &lt;/a&gt; ANSI Class II vest has 100% polyester mesh front and back for cooler comfort. Lime green color vest features 2"-wide, silver reflective stripes over 4-1/2"-wide, contrasting orange stripes for extreme visibility. Inside features a 6-division, two-tier pencil pocket and lower patch pocket. Front, metal zipper closure. Machine washable, imported.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORKER VISIBILITY MANDATED BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 24, 2008 Federal Rule 23 CFR 634 goes into effect. In summary it states that anyone working in the right-of-way of a federal-aid highway must be wearing high-visibility clothing that meets the requirements of ANSI/ISEA 107-2004 edition class 2 or 3. This rule affects all workers including emergency responder's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class 1- When workers are well separated from traffic less than 25 mph • Parking Lot Attendants • Shopping Cart Retrievers • Warehouse Workers • Roadside/Sidewalk Maintenance Workers • Delivery Vehicle Drivers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class 2 - When workers are on or near roadways 25 to 50 mph • Roadway Construction Workers • Utility Workers Survey Crews • Law Enforcement Personnel• School Crossing Guards • High-volume Parking Lot or Toll-gate Personnel • Airport baggage handlers and ground crews • Railway Workers • Emergency Response Personnel • Accident Site Investigator. Workers should be wearing &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,82.html"&gt;Carhartt High Visibility&lt;/a&gt; ANSI Class II Vest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class 3 - When workers are in high-risk situations.  It allows them to be seen from a minimum distance of 1,280 feet.

The limit is two roosters daily, four in possession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bird hunters often find opportunity in the late season in areas that were too wet earlier in the year, but can now be accessed because the standing water is frozen," explained upland game bird biologist Al Stewart.

The game is indoors, but the tailgating isn’t; and the average high temperature in February could be 36-degrees or colder. That’s darned cold. Dressing the part for cold weather is critical, no matter where you’re tailgating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main cold weather danger is hypothermia, especially among older people whose skin is less sensitive to the cold so they don’t see signs of exposure to dangerously cold temperatures. If anyone at your tailgate experiences violent shivering, stops shivering, has slow breathing with a slow pulse and seems confused, take them to a warm place and call for medical help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your cold weather science lesson is about insulation, which prevents all of that. Dressing in layers creates room for air pockets, which lock in heat. This retains body heat and, if done correctly, will keep you dry. A hat is critical to locking in your body heat, too. Don’t think you need one, or you’re worried about your hair? Up to 90% of your body heat can be lost through the top of your head. Wear the hat and bring a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, dressing in layers doesn’t just mean anything on top of anything else. It’s important to layer properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inner Layer: This layer should be a material that will “wicks” moisture from your body to help keep you dry and comfortable. What’s wicking? It’s the garments ability to move sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment where it evaporates. Most garments will tell you on the label if they’re made of a wicking material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle Layer: The middle layer should trap warm air and hold it in those air pockets we talked about. Depending on how cold it is outside you may need several middle layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outer Layer: This layer needs to provide protection from wind, rain, snow and other cold weather beasts. It is important for the outer layer to be water resistant enough to keep the inner layers dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down and wool are good materials for the middle layers, and there are a number of synthetic materials now that are designed just for this purpose. And just because you’re trying to stay warm doesn’t mean all these layers need to be thick. Your clothes still need to give you freedom of movement. Remember, it’s the science of the air pockets that’s keeping you warm. Lastly, don’t forget your feet. If your feet are wet and cold your whole body is going to feel wet and cold.

Summer attire, of course, is less restrictive and offers more freedom of movement (as well as a greater color selection), but anyone who's ever worked on scaffolding in cold conditions or tried to finish a job while standing in the pouring rain recognizes the importance of function over form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Carhartt collection includes &lt;a title="Carhartt Coats" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,79.html"&gt;Carhartt coats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Carhartt Jackets" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,93.html"&gt;Carhartt jackets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Carhartt Sweatshirts" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,86.html"&gt;Carhartt hoodies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Carhartt Vests" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,94.html"&gt;Carhartt vests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Carhartt Work Pants" href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,101.html"&gt;Carhartt pants&lt;/a&gt;. Look for blanket-lined, quilted insulation to provide the utmost comfort. Many coats also accommodate optional hoods. Pockets are abundant but not cumbersome; instead, they provide just the right amount of space to hold essential items without creating a burden. For those individuals who work inside chilly warehouses or around grocery store freezers, these practical coveralls and bibs are available in insulated and non-insulated varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;No outfit is complete without the right accessories. Though laymen may simply seek items that complement their everyday ensembles, the Carhartt shopper is typically searching for something more particular.

"We need all the help we can get this year."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For more than a decade, hunters in Michigan have done an outstanding job in donating venison to help families in need in all parts of the state," said DNR Director Rebecca Humphries. "We are grateful for the support of hunters who donate venison, whether it's as little as a few pounds or the whole deer."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, a recent report by a North Dakota researcher has brought up the issue of lead fragments in venison, prompting the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to inform hunters of ways to reduce their exposure to lead in venison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many hunters know, a controversy has developed surrounding lead contamination of venison. This is because high-velocity rifle bullets will sometimes fragment on impact, especially if they hit bone. The small fragments are likely too small to be seen or felt while chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to reduce potential exposure to lead. For example, hunters may select loads that are less likely to fragment; or non-toxic loads that contain little or no lead. In addition, slower shotguns and M7 projectiles do not fragment the way high velocity lead bullets do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of weapon, once a deer has been taken, liberal trimming around the wound channel will help limit lead exposure. Discard any meat that is bruised, discolored or contains hair, dirt, or bone fragments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lead fragments have been found, but we don't know that it's a health risk," said Michigan Department of Natural Resources veterinarian Steve Schmitt. "People have been consuming venison for hundreds of years and may have been consuming some lead fragments, but we're not aware of any health problems. Whether or not it's a risk, we don't know." People who are concerned about ingesting lead with their venison might limit themselves to whole cuts, as opposed to ground meat. A study by the Federal Center for Disease on whether lead in venison poses health risks to humans is expected to be completed soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the program or for a list of participating licensed processors, visit the MSAH Web site at &lt;a href="http://www.sportsmenagainsthunger.org/"&gt;www.sportsmenagainsthunger.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-5800867370475606553?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/5800867370475606553/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/michigan-hunters-can-help-fight-hunger.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/5800867370475606553?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/5800867370475606553?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/michigan-hunters-can-help-fight-hunger.html" title="Michigan Hunters Can Help Fight Hunger" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;DU4EQH8-eCp7ImA9WxRVGUk.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-5238537484551087892</id><published>2008-11-17T10:49:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-17T10:51:41.150-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-11-17T10:51:41.150-08:00</app:edited><title>Benefits of Quality Deer Management</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many hunters unfamiliar with Quality Deer Management (QDM) incorrectly assume QDM is only about large-antlered bucks. Many also feel antler point restrictions (APRs) are synonymous with QDM. Pieces from both of these beliefs can be parts of QDM programs but QDM is about much more than just antlers or APRs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality Deer Management (QDM) is a management philosophy/practice that unites landowners, hunters, and managers in a common goal of producing biologically and socially balanced deer herds within existing environmental, social, and legal constraints. This approach typically involves the protection of young bucks (yearlings and some 2.5 year-olds) combined with an adequate harvest of female deer to maintain a healthy population in balance with existing habitat conditions and landowner desires. This level of deer management involves the production of quality deer (bucks, does, and fawns), quality habitat, quality hunting experiences, and, most importantly, quality hunters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality habitat is important for bucks and does in all age classes. Does need nutritious forage to raise healthy fawns, bucks need it for large bodies and antlers, and both sexes require adequate cover to escape predation. Given the average deer eats 2,000 pounds of vegetation annually, it’s easy to see a tremendous amount of forage is necessary to support even a low-density deer herd. Larger herds and herds managed to maximize body and antler growth and reproductive capacity require even more high-quality foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simplest terms QDM involves balancing the deer herd with the habitat and having deer - bucks and does - in multiple age classes. Determining and achieving the right number of deer for the habitat is a topic for another discussion and this article will focus on multiple age classes of deer. Most areas have a good age structure for the doe population as it is common for hunters to harvest does 1.5-6.5+yrs. This age structure exists because of traditional deer management practices where hunters focused much of their harvest pressure on bucks and allowed does to survive and fill multiple age classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big question then is what is the best way to protect yearling bucks? Antler point restrictions are a common technique and they involve establishing a minimum number of points a buck must possess to be eligible for harvest. The disadvantage of APRs is the number of antler points is a poor predictor of animal age. Yearling bucks can have a rack ranging from short spikes to 10+ points. Therefore it can be difficult with APRs to protect the majority of the yearling age class while still making other age classes available for harvest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality Deer Management isn’t about protecting bucks until they are 5.5yrs old - that’s trophy management. Quality Deer Management, in simplest terms is about protecting yearling bucks. Yearling bucks are the easiest adult deer to harvest, but if hunters pass them and allow them to reach 2.5yrs, they become a little smarter and some will avoid hunters and reach 3.5yrs. Pretty soon you end up with a deer population that has bucks in multiple age classes even while allowing bucks 2.5yrs and older to be harvested. A complete age structure is good for deer and great for hunters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-5238537484551087892?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/5238537484551087892/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/benefits-of-quality-deer-management.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/5238537484551087892?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/5238537484551087892?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/benefits-of-quality-deer-management.html" title="Benefits of Quality Deer Management" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CEMBQXc7cSp7ImA9WxRVFE8.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-59974907440968347</id><published>2008-11-11T08:42:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-11T08:54:10.909-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-11-11T08:54:10.909-08:00</app:edited><title>IT’S TAILGATING TIME</title><content type="html">In North America, a tailgate party is a social event held on and around the open tailgate of a vehicle. Tailgating often involves consuming alcoholic beverages and grilling food. When it comes to tailgating, the best locations are too numerous to count. You can tailgate at concerts, auto races, football games, basketball games, hockey games, soccer games, kids sporting events, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can never take too much, when it comes to tailgating -- whether it be food, drink, or gadgets. And everyone knows that grilling dogs, burgers, and brats along with downing a few brews is an important part of the tailgating experience, that and the aroma of bar-b-que permeating the air. It's important to recognize that most tailgating delicacies are high in fat and cholesterol, so give yourself permission to enjoy. Take a break from your low-fat diet, grab a roll of paper towels, and enjoy.  As far as liquid refreshments go, it’s all about the beer.  And remember, alcohol only provides temporary warmth. Too much will de-sensitize you to the cold, but not protect you from its effects.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Make a Tailgating Checklist To ensure nothing gets left at home, make a list of things you need to take to the tailgate party. Be sure to put your game tickets on the list too! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a Tailgating Theme Think up a creative theme for your tailgate. If it's Thanksgiving, bring a turkey. If it's Christmas, bring a tree. Or, base your theme and decorations on the opponent. For example, you might have Cajun food against the Saints, Philly cheese steaks against the Eagles, or fish against the Dolphins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dress for the Occasion, but make sure to dress appropriately for several hours outdoors -- and be prepared for drastic temperature changes. And don't forget to wear comfortable shoes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Show Some Tailgating Team Spirit Show your team spirit... Wear team colors. Tailgaters are usually the biggest and best fans! After all, to become the ultimate tailgater, you'll want to stir up some tailgater's envy! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timing is Everything Get there early. You'll want to arrive 3-4 hours before game time to beat the crowd and claim your turf. And, plan to stay late so as to not miss a moment of the post-game enthusiasm.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Location, Location, Location Set up your tailgate party near a grassy area, or bring a roll of Astroturf to set up at the end of the row -- for a more comfortable atmosphere with lots of room to socialize. Parking at the end of a row can also give you more partying space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tailgating in Parking Lots Serious tailgaters choose a parking lot that has a view of the stadium if on-site parking is not available. Since the stadium is your Mecca, you need to be able to see it so you can bow to it occasionally.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mark Your Spot At The Tailgating Party A flag or team pennant on a tall pole helps people locate the party and makes a statement of team spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So remember, when it comes to tailgating it's families and friends, it's fans, it's a community social,  it's pre-game, halftime, post-game and more.  It's the total game day experience! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By:  Mike Girolami, President WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford, MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-59974907440968347?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/59974907440968347/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/its-tailgating-time.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/59974907440968347?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/59974907440968347?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/its-tailgating-time.html" title="IT’S TAILGATING TIME" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CUMCSXg-eip7ImA9WxRWGU0.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-5953111129023896274</id><published>2008-11-05T08:37:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-05T08:44:28.652-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-11-05T08:44:28.652-08:00</app:edited><title>Ruffed Grouse - Top Game Bird</title><content type="html">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YIe-dMvXegk/SRHNJsZx68I/AAAAAAAAABM/gjeIvydmaqY/s1600-h/Ruffed_Grouse.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265215005794626498" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 137px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 103px" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YIe-dMvXegk/SRHNJsZx68I/AAAAAAAAABM/gjeIvydmaqY/s200/Ruffed_Grouse.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most prized game bird of upland game hunters in the northern belt of states is the &lt;a name="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ruffed grouse, one of a large family of birds that inhabit North America. In the same family is the pinnated grouse commonly known as the prairie chicken. In the Northeast they are found in company with the blue and spruce grouse. Ruffs weigh from one to two pounds average and are about sixteen inches in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grouse vies for the honors with the Chinese pheasant as to which is the number one sport bird. To be sure there are more who hunt pheasants simply because they are more plentiful and easier to shoot, because they are largely farm birds. The grouse, on the other hand, is a creature of the wild forests and finds his home in deserted farms and open areas where the loggers have left brush growth in the forests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grouse are readily identified by the black and brown-banded fan-shaped tail, the two tufts or ruffs on each side of the neck and the crested head. Both male and female are colored alike. There are two general hues of color, one gray and the other rust-red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most interesting time of the year is in the spring, when they are in the mating mood and when they can be seen and photographed while drumming on a log to attract a female. The whirr of their wings can be heard for some distance in the woods, as they vibrate their flight feathers in a terrific dance to impress their mate-to-be. At this time it is possible to approach with the camera for some excellent photos of the courtship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their flight when aroused is quick and erratic. They explode from the brush and quite often the gunner or observer is shocked momentarily because of the sudden sound coming from almost beneath his feet. The course of flight from there on out will be one of zig-zags through the leaves and branches as the bird tries to put as much natural cover between himself and you. No two grouse ever rise in the same way, so there is no characteristic flight to study in order to be a better shot. Hunters who are successful on grouse shoot instinctively. Somehow or other their shotgun barrels seem to point in the right direction, with enough lead to deliver the shot pattern on target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grouse are best hunted with dogs, preferably a springer spaniel or perhaps an English setter. These dogs should be trained for grouse specifically, since grouse act entirely differently than pheasants or other game birds. A good quail dog is often at a loss, due to a strange and complicated terrain. The perfect experience is enjoyed with a good dog who is able to locate a grouse on the ground and hold it on point until the hunter moves up to flush it. If the bird is shot, its coloration blends so perfectly with the forest floor that the dog, with his keen sense of smell is relied upon to fetch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grouse usually live to an age of about six years and are able to stand the severe winters of the northern climes. The key to their survival is food, mostly berries and seeds, and a good supply of unpolluted water. They prefer to live near the hemlock and pine forests where they can dodge their predators and take flight into the thick trees. Near their protective haunts, they must have a generous food supply year-round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;http://www.workwear1.com/&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing and Wolverine Work Clothing, Redford MI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-5953111129023896274?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/5953111129023896274/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/ruffed-grouse-top-game-bird.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/5953111129023896274?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/5953111129023896274?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/ruffed-grouse-top-game-bird.html" title="Ruffed Grouse - Top Game Bird" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_YIe-dMvXegk/SRHNJsZx68I/AAAAAAAAABM/gjeIvydmaqY/s72-c/Ruffed_Grouse.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;DE8GQ3wycCp7ImA9WxRWF0k.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-4065936906088661955</id><published>2008-11-03T13:11:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-03T13:13:42.298-08:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-11-03T13:13:42.298-08:00</app:edited><title>2008 Michigan Ruffed Grouse Report</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The early season reports from ruffed grouse and American woodcock cooperators allow biologists to quickly assess hunter success and local field conditions across the state of Michigan at the beginning of the grouse season.  This report is a summary of their responses for September 15 – 18, 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperators returned 95 useable surveys. They hunted 493 hours in 43 counties during the survey period.  Individual counties having at least 10 hours of hunting with the highest flush rate for grouse were Marquette, Gladwin, Ontonagon, Grand Traverse, and Crawford.  Although the woodcock season was not open during the survey period, cooperators were asked to also count woodcock flushes.  Individual counties having at least 10 hours of hunting with the highest flush rates of woodcock were Wexford, Allegan, Gladwin, Kalkaska and Mackinac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 44% of the respondents thought grouse populations were up or slightly up from last year in the areas they hunted, with 32% reporting populations about the same as the previous year.  About 29% of the respondents thought woodcock populations were up or slightly up from last year.  However, 32% thought woodcock numbers were the same and 38% thought that the numbers were down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruffed grouse have approximately ten-year cycles in abundance over much of Canada, Alaska and the Great Lakes states of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan.  Many theories have been proposed to explain these cycles including diseases, weather, forest fires, sunspots, starvation, crowding, predators, genetic changes and chance.  It appears that we may be at the midway point of the ten-year cycle.  However, hunters should note that increased or decreased abundance of animals at a regional scale does not ensure the same trend locally.  The best grouse and woodcock hunting opportunities will be in areas of young early forest successional habitat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several hunters commented on the 2-3 days of very wet conditions in many areas of Michigan prior to the opener of the grouse season.  Hunters also commented on good food availability for grouse.  Some hunters said that they would prefer that grouse season open later in the season when there is less foliage.  Some hunters suggested that grouse and woodcock season open on the same day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-4065936906088661955?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/4065936906088661955/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/2008-michigan-ruffed-grouse-report.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/4065936906088661955?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/4065936906088661955?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/11/2008-michigan-ruffed-grouse-report.html" title="2008 Michigan Ruffed Grouse Report" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;A0YHRXk8eSp7ImA9WxRWEk0.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-7875211292540504580</id><published>2008-10-28T08:25:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-28T08:52:14.771-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-10-28T08:52:14.771-07:00</app:edited><title>WHAT EVERY HUNTER NEEDS FOR THE HUNT</title><content type="html">Michigan weather can be unpredictable for the hunting season.  We have seen warm weather during this time, but most of the time we pray for a nice light snow fall.  In Michigan cold weather deer hunting requires the hunter to prepare properly and make sure he or she has the right clothing and equipment for prolonged exposure to the elements. Humans must maintain a stable body temperature during cold weather hunting. When away from external sources of heat, our only heat source is that which we produce internally. This inner warmth primarily comes from burning food, or the oxidation of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are available in the form of raisins, chocolate, candy, and fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best dress for cold weather hunting is to wear clothing that preserves body heat while allowing body moisture to evaporate freely. This is accomplished through layering, or wearing alternate layers of clothing to provide insulation and ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before heading out in the woods here are a few things that every hunter will need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Camouflage &lt;br /&gt;• Tree stands/blind &lt;br /&gt;• Weapon &lt;br /&gt;• Waterproof boots &lt;br /&gt;• Knife &lt;br /&gt;• Tags &lt;br /&gt;• Orange clothing &lt;br /&gt;• Permit. &lt;br /&gt;• Spotlight &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/page.htm?P6=CAMO"&gt;Camouflage&lt;/a&gt; has been used for ages and while it is very important, it is not essential, especially during gun season when it is required that hunters wear blaze orange clothing when on public land. There are many different types of deer stands, ladder stands, climbers and stationary blinds. Ladder stands are ladders with a platform on top of them chained to a tree. Climber stands are platforms with a seat that may be carried on your back and then placed usually about 4-8 feet off the ground on a tree. Stationary blinds, built from wood and other materials are meant to be a durable and long-lasting blind either on a stand or on the ground, depending on the terrain. No hunter may take down a deer easily or legally without using certain weapons when they are permitted. Waterproof boots are not essential, but are handy, especially since deer do not always fall down when shot, and may run for a few hundred yards into unfamiliar woods. Knives are essential for skinning and field dressing deer. Tags and permits are required to hunt deer legally, and may be purchased from sporting good stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, Local Distributor of Carhartt  WorkCamo clothing, Redford MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-7875211292540504580?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/7875211292540504580/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/what-every-hunter-needs-for-hunt.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/7875211292540504580?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/7875211292540504580?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/what-every-hunter-needs-for-hunt.html" title="WHAT EVERY HUNTER NEEDS FOR THE HUNT" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CkYGQnk8eCp7ImA9WxRWEU8.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-4268125306205973930</id><published>2008-10-27T08:07:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-27T08:08:43.770-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-10-27T08:08:43.770-07:00</app:edited><title>Tips for Asking Permission to Hunt Private Land</title><content type="html">There is a lot of state land available in the state to hunt.  But, there are times and locations that state land borders private land and having access to the property would increase the success of the hunt.  For all you hunters, the key to getting permission to hunt private land is the way you approach the landowner.  Here are just a few tips on obtaining permission to hunt private land. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;State law requires you obtain verbal permission from the landowner. Only the landowner can give hunting permission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obtain permission to hunt several farms. This assures you of a place to hunt if others are using the property or the landowner is not home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always obtain permission well in advance of the time you plan to hunt. Plan your visit early in the evening when the landowner, especially if a farmer, is likely to be home. If you will scout the area before hunting season, also request permission for that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask for permission by yourself or with one other person; do not take your hunting party up to the door. When approaching the landowner or family for permission. NEVER carry your gun and keep any dogs in your vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cannot visit the landowner, write an appropriate and friendly letter. Do not stick a note on the door. Your letter may request a date/time to talk in person, or you can make arrangements by mail or telephone. Do so at the landowner's preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to provide your name and contact information and the dates and times when you would like to hunt a described portion of their land (e.g., the back 40 acres of the woods and cropland). Landowner may limit party size, ORVs or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask if there are crop fields or areas of the farm that should not be hunted.&lt;br /&gt;Never shoot near farm buildings or where any people or livestock are living. Observe all safety zone areas - 452 feet from possibly inhabited structures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave any gates you encounter the way you found them. If a gate is open, leave it open after you pass through. If a gate is closed, close it after you pass through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave any trash. If you find litter already there, pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the hunt is over, always thank the landowner. They then will know that you have left the farm and will not worry about you being lost or stuck on their property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offer the landowner a portion of your harvest off their land, such as a piece of game or portion of venison once your game is cleaned (or butchered). This gesture will help your relationship with the landowner. It also may help provide others with hunting opportunities from this landowner, and it helps build a positive image of hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just remember when obtaining permission to hunt that private land, be respectful, courteous and leave nothing behind.  Treat that land as if were your own.  Go out and enjoy the fall hunting season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;., a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford, MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-4268125306205973930?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/4268125306205973930/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/tips-for-asking-permission-to-hunt.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/4268125306205973930?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/4268125306205973930?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/tips-for-asking-permission-to-hunt.html" title="Tips for Asking Permission to Hunt Private Land" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CUQHQX08cSp7ImA9WxRXFk0.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-7371254773019721686</id><published>2008-10-21T08:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-21T08:35:30.379-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-10-21T08:35:30.379-07:00</app:edited><title>UPDATED REPORT ON CWD</title><content type="html">Department of Natural Resources Director Rebecca Humphries issued an interim order placing an immediate ban on baiting and feeding on Aug. 26, after a captive deer from a privately owned facility tested positive for chronic wasting disease. Humphries' order, as prescribed by the state's CWD emergency response plan adopted in 2002, would have expired Feb. 26, 2009, but the NRC action removes the expiration date and makes the ban permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the NRC approved orders that require hunters who take a deer in the nine townships that comprise the CWD Surveillance Zone in northern Kent County to come to a DNR deer check station. The orders also regulate the movement of carcasses from the Surveillance Zone and give replacement kill tags to any hunter who presents a deer at a check station that shows signs of CWD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NRC action is just the latest effort in a campaign designed to prevent the spread of CWD, an always fatal neurological disease of deer, elk and moose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Sept. 1, DNR conservation officers have issued 102 tickets for illegal deer and elk baiting in the Lower Peninsula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There has been talk that we weren't going to be able to enforce this baiting ban in the Lower Peninsula, but the number of tickets we have issued so far shows that we are very serious about enforcement of the ban," said Humphries. "Our primary goal is to protect the health of our wild white-tailed deer and elk populations. Stopping CWD from becoming established in our wild deer and elk is our top priority."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We appreciate the hunters who have abided by the ban and are no longer baiting," Humphries added. "Protecting the resource --white-tailed deer and elk -- should be everyone's priority."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DNR's Law Enforcement Division reported that in a period from Sept. 22 to Oct.5, 34.6 percent of the calls to the Report All Poaching (RAP) hotline concerned illegal baiting. Last year during a similar time frame, baiting complaints made up only 11.3 percent of the RAP hotline calls. While there was no baiting and feeding ban in 2007, the complaints last year would have related to over-baiting or baiting in the Bovine Tuberculosis zone in northeast Lower Michigan. "We are encouraged that sportsmen and women are taking part in this initiative," Humphries said. "We appreciate them taking the health of our deer herd as seriously as we do."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the CWD-positive deer was discovered, the DNR has tested 1,095 deer statewide; of those, 964 tested negative with the remaining 131 tests are pending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, a Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-7371254773019721686?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/7371254773019721686/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/updated-report-on-cwd.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/7371254773019721686?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/7371254773019721686?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/updated-report-on-cwd.html" title="UPDATED REPORT ON CWD" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;DUUMSHc9eCp7ImA9WxRXEko.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-3347212248501598731</id><published>2008-10-17T13:47:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-17T14:01:29.960-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-10-17T14:01:29.960-07:00</app:edited><title>IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT THE HUNT</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you head out for the deer hunting season, and the same old complaint comes “I swear you go just for the fun of it”, remind them of the economic and nutritional value venison has. It may not in your dinner plans very often, but it can actually be a great addition to a healthy diet plan. So the next time you’re offered venison, consider these facts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Venison is a very good source of protein, while, unlike most meats, it tends to be fairly low in fat, especially saturated fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four ounces of venison supplies 68.5% of the daily value for protein for only 179 calories and 1.4 grams of saturated fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Venison is a good source of iron, providing 28.2% of the daily value for iron in that same four-ounce serving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Venison is also a very good source of vitamin B12, providing 60.0% of the daily value for this important vitamin, as well as good or very good amounts of several other of the B vitamins, including riboflavin (40.0% of riboflavin's daily value), niacin (38.0% of niacin's DV) and vitamin B6 (21.5% of the DV for B6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Venison is a very good source of both protein and vitamin B12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is also a very good source vitamin B12 and niacin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lastly, venison is a good source of iron, phosphorus, vitamin B6, selenium, zinc and copper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venison may be eaten as steaks, roasts, sausages, jerky and minced meat. It has a flavor similar to beef, but is much leaner and the fibers of the meat are short and tender. Organ meats are sometimes eaten, but would not be called Venison; rather, they are called humble, as in the phrase "humble pie." Venison is lower in calories, cholesterol and fat than most cuts of beef, pork, or lamb. Here are just a few of my favorite recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venison Marinade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup fresh lemon juice&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon liquid smoke&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon salt&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper&lt;br /&gt;1/2 teaspoon red hot pepper flakes&lt;br /&gt;3 garlic cloves - crushed&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon shredded lemon peel&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano, cilantro, basil or dill.

Makes about 1 cup of venison marinate.&lt;br /&gt;How to use&lt;br /&gt;Use as soon as possible because of its freshness. Marinate venison overnight or for several hours (4-6). This marinate can also be used as a basting sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venison Stew&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 tablespoons olive oil&lt;br /&gt;2 pounds venison stew meat&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup flour&lt;br /&gt;2 cups chopped onions&lt;br /&gt;2 cloves garlic chopped&lt;br /&gt;1 cup chopped celery&lt;br /&gt;1 cup chopped carrots&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon chopped garlic&lt;br /&gt;1 cup chopped tomatoes, peeled and seeded&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme&lt;br /&gt;2 bay leaves&lt;br /&gt;1 cup red wine&lt;br /&gt;4 cups brown stock&lt;br /&gt;Salt and black pepper&lt;br /&gt;Crusty bread&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a large pot, over high heat, add the olive oil. In a mixing bowl, toss the venison with flour. When the oil is hot, sear the meat for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the onions, garlic and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the celery and carrots. Season with salt and pepper. Sauté for 2 minutes. Add the garlic, tomatoes, basil, thyme, and bay leaves to the pan. Season with salt and pepper. Deglaze the pan with the red wine. Add the brown stock. Bring the liquid up to a boil, cover and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the stew for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is very tender. If the liquid evaporates too much add a little more stock.&lt;br /&gt;Remove the stew from the oven and serve in shallow bowls with crusty bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venison Jerky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 pounds very lean venison, trimmed of all fat&lt;br /&gt;3 tablespoons kosher salt&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons ground black pepper&lt;br /&gt;1 tablespoon liquid smoke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut the meat into strips 1-inch wide and 1/2-inch thick, and spread on baking sheets. In a bowl blend the seasonings. Season the meat strips on 1 side, then turn and season the second side. Refrigerate, covered, overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.&lt;br /&gt;Cook the meat until it is completely dried, 6 to 8 hours, turning as needed to dry uniformly. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Eat as desired, or keep tightly covered, refrigerated, for up to 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, Local Distributor of Carhartt WorkCamo clothing, Redford MI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-3347212248501598731?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/3347212248501598731/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/its-not-just-about-hunt.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/3347212248501598731?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/3347212248501598731?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/its-not-just-about-hunt.html" title="IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT THE HUNT" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;DU8NR3g5fSp7ImA9WxRXEko.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-703244450219963962</id><published>2008-10-14T09:39:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-17T14:11:36.625-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-10-17T14:11:36.625-07:00</app:edited><title>SUCCESSFUL TURKEY HUNTERS ARE GOOD SCOUTS</title><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even though the Fall Turkey season has been open since October 6th the DNR reminds hunters that plenty of leftover fall turkey licenses are available for purchase for many of the wild turkey management units. Licenses remain available for 12 of the 17 hunts that run through Nov. 14. Most of the leftover licenses are for private land only, but many general licenses, which are valid for both public and private land, remain for two units: Unit M in the Upper Peninsula, and Unit J, which includes Emmet, Cheboygan, Charlevoix, Antrim, and Otsego counties. Fall turkey seasons are used as a means of controlling turkey populations in areas where populations are high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important component to successful fall turkey hunting is locating birds. Scout for tracks, fresh droppings and feathers. Good areas for sighting flocks are in idle fields and woodlands and near logging trails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fall, turkeys spend most of their time feeding on insects and mast crops like acorns. Locate a good food source where birds are congregating and learn the habits of the birds. An important component to successful fall turkey hunting is locating birds. Scout for tracks, fresh droppings and feathers. Good areas for sighting flocks are in idle fields and woodlands and near logging trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen for the sounds of birds scratching in the leaves or listen for their "flock talk" as they come and go to roost. Roosting flocks may produce a wide variety of "yelps", "clucks", "kee-kees" and "gobbles." Once a flock has been located, one hunting tactic is to scatter the flock. Approach the flock within 50 yards and flush the birds so they will scatter. A dispersed flock normally will begin to regroup within 15 to 30 minutes near the original point of separation. Quickly set up at this spot. Begin calling the turkeys by imitating the same sounds made by the birds as the flock begins to reassemble. Poults will give the kee-kee lost call mixed with yelps and clucks. Answer every turkey call heard with similar tone, pitch and rhythm. Using a decoy also may help fool birds into approaching your location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Successful hunters sit still and allow the birds to come to them. Being &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/page.htm?PG=CAMO"&gt;camouflaged&lt;/a&gt; does not make you invisible. Movement is the greatest enemy of the turkey hunter. A turkey can detect and react to movement 10 times faster than a human. Even though &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/page.htm?PG=CAMO"&gt;camouflaged&lt;/a&gt;, you still are an unnatural form in the woods. Do not attempt to stalk a turkey. First, that gobbler or hen you are stalking may turn out to be another hunter. Second, your chances of success are poor. At best, you might get a glimpse of tail feathers. Do not jump and turn at a turkey approaching from behind. The chance of getting a good shot is very slim. Be patient, remain still and let the bird pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YIe-dMvXegk/SPj_G_nWLeI/AAAAAAAAABE/ONMFx-zI_Ic/s1600-h/Hunt-Turkey.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YIe-dMvXegk/SPj_G_nWLeI/AAAAAAAAABE/ONMFx-zI_Ic/s320/Hunt-Turkey.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5258233060575817186" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assume another person is making every sound you hear. Many turkey hunters are very convincing callers. Always keep a safe distance. If a bird turns out to be another hunter, it could be very dangerous. If another hunter is working a flock, do not interfere by calling or spooking the birds. Always give other hunters the same respect that you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fall, both hens and gobblers are legal targets. Make sure the bird is within range of the shotgun and shoot at the neck and head only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know the capabilities of your gun or bow and use it safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be positive of your target.

The ban applies equally to feeding for recreational viewing as well as hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequently asked questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Baiting? Bating is defined as putting out food materials composed of grains, minerals, salt, fruit, vegetables, hay or any other food material, whether natural or manufactured for deer, to attract, lure, or entice them as an aid in hunting.  A person baiting deer must comply with the current baiting regulations. Baiting for elk is illegal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Feeding? Feeding is defined as placing food materials out that attract deer or elk for any other reason except hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recreational Feeding is feeding for wildlife viewing purposes only.  A person feeding deer must comply with the regulations for recreational viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplemental Feeding of deer and/or elk is prohibited in Michigan except for specific portions of 8 counties in the Upper Peninsula. Supplemental feeding of deer is by permit only, if specific conditions are met, and is only allowed in a specific portion of State. The supplemental deer feeding area is all portions of Ontonagon, Houghton, Keweenaw, Baraga, Alger, and Luce counties, and those portions of Marquette and Chippewa counties north of the T43N-T44N boundary line. Contact a DNR office if you have questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food plots are naturally occurring foods, standing agricultural crops, or foods that are placed as a result of using normal farming practices, and are not considered baiting or feeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are Cervids? They are ruminant mammals, in the scientific classification of family cervidae, or deer, elk, and moose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this ban necessary? Yes. Biologists have long known that disease is easily spread among animals that are drawn into close physical proximity by feed. Although the exact means of transmission of chronic wasting disease is not known, most scientists believe any exchange of bodily fluids -- saliva, urine, feces – facilitates transmission. A healthy white-tailed deer population in Michigan is important for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;• Chronic wasting disease can spread through the deer herd.&lt;br /&gt;• Without appropriate management within the current CWD surveillance zone, the  disease may spread to other areas of the state.&lt;br /&gt;• All deer infected with CWD die from the disease.&lt;br /&gt;• White-tailed deer are native to Michigan and it is important to preserve our native wildlife.&lt;br /&gt;• Any regional threat to a healthy deer population is a statewide concern.&lt;br /&gt;• A healthy deer herd is important for hunting traditions. Michigan has more than 725,000 deer hunters who have harvested an average of 450,000 deer annually during the past decade.  Deer hunting contributes more than 10 million days of recreation every year.&lt;br /&gt;• Deer hunting annually generates more than $500 million dollars impact to the state’s economy. A healthy deer herd is critical to the state's economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Upper Peninsula:&lt;br /&gt;Baiting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volume of bait scattered on the ground cannot exceed two (2) gallons at any one hunting site at anytime. This includes new and old bait combined. Baiting can occur only from October 1 to January 1. The bait material may be of any food type.   The bait must be dispersed over a minimum of a 10-foot by 10-foot area. The bait can be scattered directly on the ground by any means, including mechanical spin-cast eders, provided that the spin-cast feeder does not distribute on the ground more than the maximum volume allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recreational Feeding for Viewing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The volume of feed on the ground cannot exceed two (2) gallons per residence at any time. This includes new and old feed combined.  Feed must be placed within 100 yards of a residence, on land owned or possessed by that person.  The feed must be scattered or dispersed directly on the ground at least 100 yards from any area accessible to livestock such as: cattle, goats, sheep, new world camelids, bison, swine, horses, or captive cervidae. Any type of food materials can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President of WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, Local Distributor of Carhartt  WorkCamo clothing, Redford MI &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-6452402046238859069?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/6452402046238859069/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/in-michigans-lower-peninsula-all.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/6452402046238859069?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/6452402046238859069?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/in-michigans-lower-peninsula-all.html" title="In Michigan's Lower Peninsula: All Baiting and Feeding of Deer and Elk is Prohibited" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CE8CQHs7fSp7ImA9WxRRGUo.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-4493648396939984464</id><published>2008-10-02T11:33:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-10-02T11:41:01.505-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-10-02T11:41:01.505-07:00</app:edited><title>Family Affair: Youth Hunting and Hunters Education</title><content type="html">Hunting is a time honored tradition in Michigan, and what better than to make it a family affair. Hunting provides Michigan families and individuals with millions of pleasurable hours of wholesome, challenging outdoor recreation. Most hunters develop an intense appreciation for the wilderness, wildlife and a clean environment through their participation in hunting. The challenge of becoming a sports-person becomes a lifelong quest. Most hunters know that the lasting fun of hunting comes only when it is conducted safely and ethically. Safe hunting begins with Hunter Education.&lt;br /&gt;Hunter education courses teach new hunters responsibility, ethics, firearm safety, wildlife conservation and wildlife identification, game care, survival and first aid. The typical hunter education course consists of two to five sessions with a total class time of 10 to 12 hours. Hunter education classes are typically held in outdoor clubs, schools, police stations, and camps.&lt;br /&gt;Since 2006 the State of Michigan has passed 2 new laws for the hunting seasons: one that lowers the hunting age and the other that creates an apprentice hunter program. The new hunting age law lowers the age for hunting game from 12 to 10 years old, and lowers the age for hunting deer, bear and elk with a firearm on private land only from age 14 to 12. Under the new law, other than on land where their parent or guardian lives, youth hunters must be supervised in the field by a licensed adult hunter who must maintain unaided visual and verbal contact with the younger hunter at all times. These new laws now let parents determine whether or not their children are ready to hunt.&lt;br /&gt;The apprentice program also gives adults who have not hunted before a chance to be mentored by an experienced hunter, so they can try the sport first before making a substantial commitment.The DNR encourages parents, guardians and other adult hunters to take a youngster hunting this year. In passing on an important heritage to a new generation of hunters, you also will be helping them learn valuable lessons about responsibility, outdoor ethics and wildlife conservation. The apprentice hunter program allows individuals to hunt without the required hunter education course if accompanied and closely monitored by a licensed hunter 21 and older who is mentoring them in the sport. An apprentice hunter may participate in the program for two license years before being required to take a hunter safety course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ten Commandments of Firearm Safety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Watch that muzzle! Keep it pointed in a safe direction at all times.&lt;br /&gt;2. Treat every firearm with the respect due a loaded gun. It might be, even if you&lt;br /&gt;think it isn’t.&lt;br /&gt;3. Be sure of the target and what is in front of it and beyond it. Know the identifying&lt;br /&gt;features of the game you hunt. Make sure you have an adequate backstop --- don’t&lt;br /&gt;shoot at a flat, hard surface or water.&lt;br /&gt;4. Keep your finger outside the trigger guard until ready to shoot. This is the best&lt;br /&gt;way to prevent an accidental discharge.&lt;br /&gt;5. Check your barrel and ammunition. Make sure the barrel and action are clear of&lt;br /&gt;obstructions and carry only the proper ammunition for your firearm.&lt;br /&gt;6. Unload firearms when not in use. Leave actions open/ carry firearms in cases and&lt;br /&gt;unloaded to and from the shooting area.&lt;br /&gt;7. Point a firearm only at something you intend to shoot. Avoid all horseplay with a&lt;br /&gt;gun&lt;br /&gt;8. Don’t run, jump or climb with a loaded firearm. Unload a firearm before you&lt;br /&gt;climb a fence or tree, or jump a ditch. Pull a firearm toward you by the butt, not&lt;br /&gt;the muzzle.&lt;br /&gt;9. Store firearms and ammunition separately and safely. Store each in secured&lt;br /&gt;locations beyond the reach of children and careless adults.&lt;br /&gt;10. Avoid alcoholic beverages before or during shooting. Also avoid mind- or&lt;br /&gt;behavior altering medicines or drugs.&lt;br /&gt;So, keep the time honored tradition alive, by getting the whole family involved in Michigan hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written By: Mike Girolami, President WorkWear1, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/"&gt;http://www.workwear1.com&lt;/a&gt;, Local Distributor of Carhartt Clothing, Redford, MI&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-4493648396939984464?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/4493648396939984464/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/family-affair-youth-hunting-and-hunters.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/4493648396939984464?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/4493648396939984464?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/10/family-affair-youth-hunting-and-hunters.html" title="Family Affair: Youth Hunting and Hunters Education" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CkINRHw7fSp7ImA9WxRRGE0.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-3790503174312666794</id><published>2008-09-30T11:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-09-30T11:49:55.205-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-09-30T11:49:55.205-07:00</app:edited><title>Michigan's First Case of Chronic Wasting Disease</title><content type="html">As we start to ready ourselves for the fall hunting season, Michigan hunters should be aware that the State of Michigan is faced with its first case of Chronic Wasting Disease that was reported in Kent County. The Michigan departments of Agriculture (MDA) and Natural Resources (DNR) confirmed the Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in a three-year old white-tailed deer from a privately owned cervid (POC) facility in Kent County.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The state has quarantined all POC facilities, prohibiting the movement of all - dead or alive - privately-owned deer, elk or moose. Officials do not yet know how the deer may have contracted the disease. To date, there is no evidence that CWD presents a risk to humans.&lt;br /&gt;Michigan's veterinarians and wildlife experts have been working to complete their investigation. They take this disease very seriously, and are using every resource available to implement response measures and stop the spread of this disease."&lt;br /&gt;CWD is a fatal neurological disease that affects deer, elk and moose. Most cases of the disease have been in western states, but in the past several years, it has spread to some midwestern and eastern states. Infected animals display abnormal behaviors, progressive weight loss and physical debilitation.&lt;br /&gt;Current evidence suggests that the disease is transmitted through infectious, self-multiplying proteins (prions) contained in saliva and other fluids of infected animals. Susceptible animals can acquire CWD by direct exposure to these fluids or also from contaminated environments. Once contaminated, research suggests that soil can remain a source of infection for long periods of time, making CWD a particularly difficult disease to eradicate.&lt;br /&gt;The DNR is asking hunters this fall to assist them by visiting check stations to allow them to take biological samples from the deer they harvest, so they can perform adequate surveillance of the free-ranging white-tailed deer herd in the area.&lt;br /&gt;Deer hunters this fall who take deer from Tyrone, Solon, Nelson, Sparta, Algoma, Courtland, Alpine, Plainfield, and Cannon townships will be required to bring their deer to a DNR check station. Deer taken in these townships are subject to mandatory deer check.&lt;br /&gt;So for all of you avid hunters getting ready for the 2008 fall hunting season, remember to check out Carhartt’s WorkCamo line of clothing. Carhartt offers a full line of cold weather clothing, which includes &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2.93.htm"&gt;Carhartt Jackets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2.89.htm"&gt;Carhartt Thermals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2.113.htm"&gt;Carhartt T Shirts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2.94.htm"&gt;Carhartt Vests&lt;/a&gt;

font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;The Carhartt Company offers blue jeans for women in multiple sizes and styles.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Ranging in size from 0-20 with inseams as low as 28” and as long as 36”.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There is a Carhartt jean to fit just about any shape or form.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Even with such a range of sizes it may be hard to determine which fit of &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,83.html"&gt;Carhartt jeans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is just right for you.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Below are some suggestions to find the Carhartt jeans that will perfectly suit your body type.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Long and Lean &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Of course if you are lucky enough to have this much sought after figure then just about any jean fit will work for you.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;You just want to make sure you are able to get a long enough pant leg.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,83.html"&gt;Carhartt jeans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have inseams that go up to 36”.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Petites&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;If you are 5’4” or shorter &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,83.html"&gt;Carhartt jeans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has just your style.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Obviously you want a jean with a short inseam.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,83.html"&gt;Carhartt jeans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have inseams as short as 28”.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If you cannot find a style that is short enough then go for the longer version and have the jeans hemmed.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Just make sure you opt for the straight cut over the boot cut, as they are easier to shorten. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;The Tummy Bulge&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Purchase a boot-cut jean because the flare at the bottom of the jean will help balance out that extra bit of tummy.&lt;span style=""&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;Also look for a jeans that closes across your waist instead of above or below your waistline.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Hipping Out &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;If your hips are on the voluptuous side look for a jean with a slightly lower waist that fits comfortably without creating a muffin top.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A straight leg will work much better as it will create a longer leg and decrease the width of your hips.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Stay away from boot cut jeans, as they will only make your thighs seem larger.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;Bubble Butt&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;If you have a bigger booty then stay away from jeans with back pockets that call attention to your behind.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Do not purchase jeans with flap pockets or with pockets that have a lot of decoration on them.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,83.html"&gt;Carhartt jeans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will suit the fanny of any woman, as the pocket design is simple and not ostentatious.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Top Heavy Troubles&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;For those of you with a larger upper body it is best to draw attention downward.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Look for the Cataract jeans in lighter denim colors.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The lighter color will also balance out your body better and help make your top appear smaller.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;" lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Cutting Crotch&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;If you find the only trouble you have when you purchase jeans is a pulling or tightness in the crotch, it could be because your body is longer and you have short legs.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Try purchasing &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.workwear1.com/browse.cfm/2,83.html"&gt;Carhartt jeans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in a petite size regardless of your height.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;"&gt;Not only does Carhartt have jeans to suite every body type but we can also provide jeans to suit any environment or activity.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Some of our jean styles come with multiple pockets for holding tools or other equipment.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In addition if you find yourself in a frigid environment, you can purchase out toasty flannel lined jeans and stay warm all day.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='//blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4939427036974162977-3095701713102677265?l=workwear1.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/feeds/3095701713102677265/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/07/carhartt-jeans-for-your-body-type.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/3095701713102677265?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4939427036974162977/posts/default/3095701713102677265?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://workwear1.blogspot.com/2008/07/carhartt-jeans-for-your-body-type.html" title="CARHARTT JEANS FOR YOUR BODY TYPE" /><author><name>Mike Girolami</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07129708506763169868</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;D0EGRn4zfSp7ImA9WxdVGUQ.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4939427036974162977.post-4785891562343015501</id><published>2008-07-25T06:57:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-25T07:20:27.085-07:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2008-07-25T07:20:27.085-07:00</app:edited><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="carhartt Jeans" /><title>Buying The Right Men’s Carhartt Jeans Every Time</title><content type="html">&lt;meta equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

 &lt;/span&gt;Here are some tips on what to look for the next time you go shopping so that you will come home with that perfect pair.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align: left;" align="left"&gt;
